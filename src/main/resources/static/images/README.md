# Train Landscape Image Setup

To add the train landscape image to the admin dashboard background:

1. **Save the train landscape image** as `train-landscape.jpg` in this directory (`src/main/resources/static/images/`)

2. **Image Requirements:**
   - File name: `train-landscape.jpg`
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher for best quality
   - The image should show a scenic train landscape

3. **Current Setup:**
   - The admin dashboard is already configured to use this image as background
   - The image will be displayed with a green overlay for better text readability
   - Background is set to cover the entire viewport with fixed attachment

4. **Alternative Images:**
   - You can replace `train-landscape.jpg` with any other train-related image
   - Just make sure to keep the same filename or update the CSS in `dashboard.html`

The dashboard will automatically use the image once it's placed in this directory!
